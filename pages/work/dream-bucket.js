                    The Dream Bucket is an app for users to create their
                    ultimate bucket list. Users are able to search and add items
                    as well as add their own ideas. They can create financial
                    goals, rank their bucket list items and add a timeline to
                    complete a particular goal. In addition, they will be able
                    to join communities of like-minded individuals to make
                    connections and go on adventures together.

                    The Problem: When people think of a bucket list, they think
                    of those paper lists where they write down their dreams.
                    Those pieces of papers can be misplaced. Or, people think
                    they will just remember those bucket list items and
                    don&apos;t even write them down at all.

                <Text pb={4}>
                    The Solution: The Dream Bucket app will keep track of your
                    list and provide suggestions if one is looking for
                    inspiration. The app also allows people to share their list
                    with friends or other users with similar interests. A handy
                    financial tool allows users to budget for their dreams.

                    the items or experiences you have or would add to a bucket
                    list? How would you manage the information you gather for
                    your bucket list experiences? If you were to use an
                    application or website to manage your bucket list, what

                    The Dream Bucket was designed for users to achieve their
                    ultimate bucket list goals. Based on our preliminary
                    research, users don&apos;t currently use an application or
                    website to manage their bucket list but rather write down
                    their ideas, which can be easily lost or misplaced.

                    process of collecting these lists much easier for the users.
                    We created an app that not only allowed the user to add a
                    bucket list item but also track their saving goals, a
                    timeline to hit that goal and a budgeting option.
